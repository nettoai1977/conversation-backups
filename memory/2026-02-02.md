## Completed Research Projects

### Multi-Agent Systems & Skills Development
- Researched multi-agent architectures (Orchestrator-worker, hierarchical, blackboard, market-based)
- Created comprehensive implementation plan with specialized agents (Email, Calendar, Research, Business, Task, Monitoring)
- Developed skills enhancement strategy with modular architecture (atomic, composite, adaptive skills)
- Created detailed documentation: multi-agent-research.md, improvement-plan.md, skills-enhancement-plan.md, executive-summary.md

### Integration Tools Research
- Researched scraper tools, MCP tools, and CLI tools for OpenClaw
- Identified advanced scraping options (Crawl4AI, Crawlee, ZenRows, Apify)
- Explored MCP protocol integration for services like Notion, Email, Calendar
- Created practical implementation guide with runnable code examples
- Generated documentation: integration-tools-research.md, enhancement-plan.md, implementation-guide.md, executive-summary-integrations.md

## Key Technical Achievements
- Successfully researched and documented multi-agent system patterns
- Created modular skills architecture for enhanced functionality
- Developed MCP server implementations for various services
- Provided practical, implementable solutions for both research areas
- All code examples are production-ready and customizable

## Current Status
- Both research projects completed with actionable recommendations
- Implementation guides ready for deployment
- Memory files created for future reference
- Ready to assist with implementation of any of the proposed solutions
