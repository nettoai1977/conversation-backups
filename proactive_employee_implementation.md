### 3. The 'While I Sleep' Mandate
- **Functionality**: Performs Deep Research or Code Optimization pass after 6 hours of inactivity
- **Output**: Prepares summary for return
- **Focus**: Current active project enhancement and optimization
- **Status**: ✅ Added to core expectations

### 4. Pre-emptive Problem Solving
- **Functionality**: Identifies and fixes potential errors in logic or bugs in code immediately
