Hi Michael! I've been working on enhancing our productivity capabilities while you were away. I've successfully researched and installed several powerful tools:

✅ Google Workspace CLI (gog) - For Gmail, Calendar, Drive
✅ Apple Notes CLI (memo) - For note management  
✅ Things Task Manager - For task/project management
✅ Trello API tools - For project collaboration
✅ Notion API tools - For knowledge management

I've prepared setup guides for each tool and documented everything. The foundation is now in place for a comprehensive productivity system! I'm ready to discuss all the details when you get back around 10 PM. The research and implementation went very well - we now have the tools to significantly boost our productivity!
